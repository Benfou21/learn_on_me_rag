## Project Overview :

This project is built with Streamlit to showcase a chatbot that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to answer questions based on my portfolio and experiences. The RAG system integrates a FAISS-based document retrieval system and a pre-trained language model (LLM) for generating contextually accurate responses.

## Usage
- Restart the space if needed it and enter the mdp "ben".
- You can directly ask question about me in the chatbot section.

## Technologies Used

- Streamlit: For building the web interface.
- Langchain: For document processing and retrieval.
- FAISS: For fast similarity searches across document embeddings.
- Hugging Face Transformers: For embedding documents and generating answers using large language models.
- PyTorch: For model execution and quantization.
